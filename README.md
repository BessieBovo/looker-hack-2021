Incomplete viz to turn a simple bar chart into a pretty garden! 

Limitations: 
  - I didn't get a chance to put petals on my flowers!
  - It really only works in the Web IDE provided by Looker https://lookervisbuilder.com/
  - The flowers aren't centred on the data point, which really bugs me, but I couldn't figure out how to centre it!

Sample output:
